/*     ------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/*     ON ENTRY: */

/*             Start = 'Basis file' means the same (but is more */
/*                      meaningful in the latter case). */
/*             Start = 'Warm' means that a basis is already defined in hs */
/*                      (probably from an earlier call). */

/*     m       is the number of rows in the constraint matrix A. */

/*          2. If the problem has a quadratic objective, */

/*             name of the jth variable (j = 1, n+m). */
/*             If j = n+i, the jth variable is the ith row. */

/*     hEtype(n+m) indicate if the variable can violate its bound in */
/*             Elastic mode. */
/*             if hEtype(j) = 0, variable j is non-elastic and must not */
/*                               be violated. */

/*             variable (x, s).  See the following NOTES. */

/*     x(n+m)  is a set of initial values for each variable (x, s). */

/*  NOTES:  1. If Start = 'Cold' or 'Basis file' and a BASIS file */

/*             (an OLD BASIS file, INSERT file or LOAD file), */
/*             hs and x need not be set at all. */

/*          2. Otherwise, hs(1:n) must be defined for a cold start. */

/*             you may set hs(j) = 0, x(j) = 0.0d+0 for all j=1:n. */
/*             All variables will be eligible for the initial basis. */

/*             Less trivially, to say that variable j will probably */
/*             be equal to one of its bounds, */
/*             set hs(j) = 4 and x(j) = bl(j) */
/*             or  hs(j) = 5 and x(j) = bu(j) as appropriate. */

/*          3. For Cold starts with no basis file, a Crash procedure */
/*             is used to select an initial basis.  The initial basis */
/*             matrix will be triangular (ignoring certain small */
/*             entries in each column). */
/*             The values hs(j) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 have the following */
/*             meaning: */

/*             hs(j)    State of variable j during Crash */

/*             0, 1, 3  Eligible for the basis.  3 is given preference. */
/*             2, 4, 5  Ignored. */

/*             After Crash, hs(j) = 2 entries are made superbasic. */
/*             Other entries not selected for the basis are made */
/*             nonbasic at the value x(j) if bl(j) <= x(j) <= bu(j), */
/*             or at the value bl(j) or bu(j) closest to x(j). */

/*          4. For Warm starts, all of hs(1:n+m) is assumed to be */
/*             set to the values 0, 1, 2 or 3 from some previous call. */

/*     nS      need not be specified for Cold starts, */
/*             but should retain its value from a previous call */
/*             when a Warm start is used. */


/*     ON EXIT: */

/*     hs(n+m) is the final state vector: */

/*             Very occasionally there may be nonbasic variables for */
/*             which x(j) lies strictly between its bounds. */
/*             If nInf = 0, basic and superbasic variables may be outside */
/*             their bounds by as much as the Feasibility tolerance. */
/*             Note that if Scale is specified, the Feasibility tolerance */
/*             applies to the variables of the SCALED problem. */
/*             In this case, the variables of the original problem may be */
/*             as much as 0.1 outside their bounds, but this is unlikely */
/*             unless the problem is very badly scaled. */
